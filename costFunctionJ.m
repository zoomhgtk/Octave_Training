function J = costFunctionJ(X, Y, Theta)% X is desgin matrix contanining all of the traning data% Y is the real pricem = size (X, 1); % how many rows does X have, m means the size of traning setPredictions = X*Theta; % here you will get a m x 1 matrix, actually this is a vector, whose length is the same as Y's, so it's ok to use Predictions substract YsqrErrors = (Predictions-Y).^2;J = 1/(2*m)*sum(sqrErrors);
